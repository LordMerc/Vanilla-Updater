Hello! This is a auto-updater for the Vanilla icons found here: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/vanilla-a-modern-look-for-your-studio/935745
**Credits**
Additional credits to @sasial-dev(https://github.com/sasial-dev) for a good overhaul including additional support for themes.

It's recommended you have this folder in the Local of AppData to make it easier on replacing.
After having this folder in Local, you can create a shortcut of the thing.bat and drag the shortcut to Desktop for easier updating. Any problems reach me on discord: LordMerc#2323

You **WILL** need Node.Js installed found here: https://nodejs.org/en/
